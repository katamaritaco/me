# Me! Nick Heindl

Welcome to my Me (:tm:) profile. Shouts to my friend [L O Z O R D](https://github.com/LOZORD/me) for the idea and inspiration.

I'm a fifth year undergrad at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I'm majoring in both [Computer Sciences](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) :computer: and [Linguistics](http://ling.wisc.edu/) :tongue:, with a certificate/minor in game development :video_game: (I believe I'll be the first person with this too!).

Besides working on some personal projects and things for the [Undergrad Projects Lab](http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/), I'm currently contracting some work for AppleTV development with [Flippfly](http://flippfly.com/) while finishing up my degree. 

I also have a site [here](http://nheindl.com/), but I keep this repo more up-to-date. Updating this repo is just so much nicer, and allows me to throw stuff up faster without worrying about some of the cruft that can come with maintaining a traditional personal site (cough cough .css). Plus, it is github, so it is a lot easier to browse through projects :+1:
