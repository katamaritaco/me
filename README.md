# Me! Nick Heindl - I love to make things :wrench:

:exclamation:NOTE:exclamation:: I also have a more traditional [portfolio site here](http://katamaritaco.github.io/) as well. 

I will still use this repository since it is easier to browse through code, has sections for my other interests, and has out of the box emoji support:+1::muscle:

![Picture of me in Egypt](nick.jpg)

This is me on New Years Eve 2014/2015 in Egypt! :camel:

Welcome to my Me (:tm:) profile. Shouts to my friend [L O Z O R D](https://github.com/LOZORD/me) for the idea and inspiration.

:trophy: In 2015, I was chosen as an [IGDA GDC Scholar](http://scholars.igda.org/about-the-scholarships/)! :trophy:

I'm a fifth year undergrad at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I'm majoring in both [Computer Sciences](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) :computer: and [Linguistics](http://ling.wisc.edu/) :tongue:, with a certificate/minor in game development :video_game: (I believe I'll be the first person with this too!).

Last Summer I worked at [Raven Software](http://www.ravensoftware.com/) on [Call of Duty Online](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty_Online). Before that, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) as a software development intern. Besides working on personal projects and things for the [Undergrad Projects Lab](http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/), I'm currently contracting some work for AppleTV:green_apple::tv: development with [Flippfly](http://flippfly.com/) while finishing up my degree. 

I'm super passionate about learning and improving the world. I was fortunate enough to help teach in Africa:camel: over my 2015 Winter break, and I'm pretty involved in the Madison games and tech communities. I love language, music, and creating things (particularly weird things). Some of my areas of interest: Game and Engine development, AI and Machine Learning, Natural Language and Computational Linguistics, Information Security, and Open Source Development.

I'm currently playing: [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/), [Diablo 3](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/), [Dark Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Cloud), [Heroes of the Storm](http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/), and [The Witness](http://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/)

My best code is currently in production at Raven and Amazon, but I listed some nice projects below. My largest available code sample is [here](https://github.com/fielddaylab/biocore-plant-id-tool) and [here](https://github.com/fielddaylab/AudioVisualizer) :muscle:. Code for my portfolio site is [here](https://github.com/katamaritaco/katamaritaco.github.io).

* I love giving talks and hosting events. You can find some [here](https://github.com/UW-UPL/Talks), and I've given other talks at [Madison Indies Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/madison-indies/). I've hosted a bunch of events from hackathons, to roundtables on internships.


## Other Interests 

### Language
I've had a fascination with language since I can remember. I've experience learning German:de: and a bit of Japanese:jp:, French:fr:, and Mandarin:cn:. 

I'm currently working on a few linguistic focused projects: an etymology of 'dank', an 'awesome-list' of linguistic resources, and possibly a paper on 'intuitive conjectures' in the field. I'll update this more as they progress.

### Hackathons
I've learned a lot by attending, running, and even giving talks at numerous hackathons! During my 'hack career' I've worked across the country with awesome people to make some amazing hacks. Some examples: A plant that tweets its feelings and a programming IDE that translates real life dance moves into usable python. 

Here are some I've attended: BoilerMake, MHacks, hackMIT, HackTech, Facebook Midwest Hack, etc.

### Music
I love music; all different kinds. Particularly fond of old skool jungle and uk 'ardcore, drum and bass, jazz, classic rock, etc. One of the happiest moments of my life was at a rave skankin' to Calyx and Teebee with 30 of the biggest Junglists in the Pacific Northwest :mega: I have two technics 1200 turntables and like to scratch records every now and then :minidisc::minidisc:

These days I've been listening to [rinsefm](http://www.rinse.fr/player/) and [subfm](http://www.sub.fm/) a decent amount.
