# Me! Nick Heindl

Welcome to my Me (:tm:) profile. Shouts to my friend [L O Z O R D](https://github.com/LOZORD/me) for the idea and inspiration.

I'm a fifth year undergrad at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I'm majoring in both [Computer Sciences](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) :computer: and [Linguistics](http://ling.wisc.edu/) :tongue:, with a certificate/minor in game development :video_game: (I believe I'll be the first person with this too!).

Last Summer I worked at [Raven Software](http://www.ravensoftware.com/) on [Call of Duty Online](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty_Online). Besides working on some personal projects and things for the [Undergrad Projects Lab](http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/), I'm currently contracting some work for AppleTV:green_apple::tv: development with [Flippfly](http://flippfly.com/) while finishing up my degree. 

I also have a site [here](http://nheindl.com/), but I keep this repo more up-to-date. Updating this repo is just so much nicer, and allows me to throw stuff up faster without worrying about some of the cruft that can come with maintaining a traditional personal site (cough cough .css). Plus, it is github, so it is a lot easier to browse through projects :+1:


This is me on New Years Eve 2014/2015 in Egypt! :camel:

* I love giving talks and hosting events. You can find some [here](https://github.com/UW-UPL/Talks), and I've given other talks at [Madison Indies Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/madison-indies/). I've hosted a bunch of events from hackathons, to roundtables on internships.


## Other Interests 

### Language
I've had a fascination with language since I can remember. I've experience learning German:de: and a bit of Japanese:jp:, French:fr:, and Mandarin:cn:. 

I'm currently working on a few linguistic focused projects: an etymology of 'dank', an 'awesome-list' of linguistic resources, and possibly a paper on 'intuitive conjectures' in the field. I'll update this more as they progress.

### Hackathons
I've learned a lot by attending numerous hackathons and even giving talks about them too! During my 'hack career' I've worked with awesome people to make some amazing hacks. Some examples: A plant that tweets its feelings and a programming IDE that translates real life dance moves into usable python. 

Here are some I've attended: BoilerMake, MHacks, hackMIT, HackTech, Facebook Midwest Hack, etc.

### Music
I love music; all different kinds. Particularly fond of old skool jungle and uk 'ardcore, drum and bass, jazz, classic rock, etc. One of the happiest moments of my life was at a rave skankin' to Calyx and Teebee with 30 of the biggest Junglists in the Pacific Northwest :mega: I have two technics 1200 turntables and like to scratch records every now and then :minidisc::minidisc:

These days I've been listening to [rinsefm](http://www.rinse.fr/player/) and [subfm](http://www.sub.fm/) a decent amount.
